# The Dangers of Skin Cancer

Skin cancer is often the last thing many think about when they are enjoying the outdoors, but it is very serious. When bare skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun, it can damage the DNA underneath. When the DNA üß¨ is altered, it can lead to uncontrollable cell growth ‚Äì also known as cancer.

- callout(Not so fun fact):
	In the US, approximately **9,500** people are diagnosed with skin cancer **every day**.

Thankfully, skin cancer can be prevented. You can protect yourself by wearing hats, sunglasses üòé and long-sleeve shirts. In addition, you can apply a broad-spectrum sunscreenüß¥to block out UVA and UVB rays.


## Different types
Learn about the difference types of skin cancer and then answer the question on the right.
There are four common types of skin cancer.

### Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is very common. It is often found on the head and neck and is the most common form of skin cancer. In the U.S. alone, an estimated **3.6 million cases** are diagnosed each year.

### Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin is the second most common form of skin cancer. The **squamous cells** are found in the middle and outer layers of the skin. When caught early, most SCCs are curable.


### Melanoma
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Look for anything **new,**  **changing** or **unusual** on your skin. Melanomas commonly appear on the legs of women, and the trunk on men. But, keep in mind, melanomas can appear anywhere-- even areas where the sun doesn‚Äôt shine!

### Actinic Keratosis (AK) 
Actinic keratosis (AK) is the most common form of precancer. It often appears as a rough, scaly patch of skin that takes years to develop. If left untreated, it can turn into skin cancer.
