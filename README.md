# Skin Cancers
A WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge Winning Playground

1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70, yet this disease is one of the easiest cancers to prevent and treat. The goal of this project is to help engage and inform people about how harmful skin cancer is and how to detect it when it appears. 

## Technologies
Swift and SwiftUI

SwiftUI made developing and prototyping very easy, the adaptability of the framework to be able to be split into smaller components allows for a clean and organized development environment. In addition, environment objects make sharing data between views seamless. Lastly, Swift is utilized to manage the updating of the moles.
